# GoldBach2x
Goldbach algorithm I made in 1 hour. Will all pairs of numbers (If you know what Goldbach is I don't have to explain). It will print ALL pairs. For instance (5+3) and (3+5) are recognized as two different pairs in the technical sense. Doesn't reference any Sieves.

Program may take a while for larger number. Meant to be run in the console/cmd/terminal.
