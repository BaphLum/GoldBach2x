# GoldBach2x
Goldbach calculatory algorithm I made in 1 hour. Will display all pairs of numbers (If you know what Goldbach is I don't have to explain). It will print ALL pairs. (Nested loop allows for only one instance of the same number duos)

What I mean by that:
8 will spit out (3 5) as opposed to (3 5) & (5 3)

Code doesn't reference any Sieves.

Program may take a while for larger number. Meant to be run in the console/cmd/terminal.
